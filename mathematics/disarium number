Given a number N, find if it is Disarium or not. A number is called Disarium if sum of its digits powered with their respective positions is equal to the number itself. Output 1 if it's Disarium, and 0 if not.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 89
Output:
1
Explanation:
8^1+9^2 = 89 thus output is 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 81
Output:
0
Explanation:
8^1+1^2 = 9 thus output is 0. 
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isDisarium() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)



int isDisarium(int N) {
       
        int posn=log10(N)+1;// amazing method to count no. of digits in a number 
        int sum=0,copy=N;
        
        while(N!=0)
        {
            sum+=pow(N%10,posn);
            N=N/10;
            posn--;
        }
        if(sum==copy)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else
        {
            return 0;
        }
       
        
    }
};
