Given a array of length N, at each step it is reduced by 1 element.
In the first step the maximum element would be removed, while in the second step minimum element of the
remaining array would be removed, in the third step again the maximum and so on. Continue this till the array contains only 1 element.
And print that final element remaining in the array.


Note:
 Sort the array . If the value of N is odd then simply print the mid(n/2) element in the new array.

If the value of N is even then print a[n/2-1] in the new array.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int s;
	    cin>>s;
	    int a[s];
	    for(int i=0;i<s;i++)
	    {
	        cin>>a[i];
	    }
	    sort(a,a+s);
	    if(s%2!=0)
	    {
	        cout<<a[s/2];
	    }
	    else
	    {
	        cout<<a[(s/2)-1];
	    }
	    cout<<"\n";
	}
	return 0;
}
