Pappu is confused between 6 & 9 . He works in billing department of abc company and his work is
to return the remaining amount to the customers. If actual remaining amount is given we need to find the maximum
possible extra amount given by the pappu to the customers.

For ex:- actual remaining amount = 56

so, maximum possible extra amount =  (59 - 56 ) = 3

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    string s,a;
	    cin>>s;
	    a=s;
	    for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
	    {
	        if(s[i]=='6')
	        {
	            a[i]='9';
	        }
	    }
	    int p=stoi(s);
	    int q=stoi(a);
	    cout<<q-p<<"\n";
	}
	return 0;
}
